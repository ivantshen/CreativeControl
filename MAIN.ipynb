      "------------------------------\n",
      "The scene unfolds in the Montague Museum, a once-grand family home now transformed into a lavish museum reminiscent of Hearst Castle. The opulent surroundings contrast sharply with the emotional intensity of the argument between Elizabeth Montague and Ethan. Elizabeth, a woman in her late thirties with fierce determination, confronts Ethan, a younger man with an air of rebelliousness. As the tension rises, the echoes of their confrontation resonate in the grand hall adorned with historical artifacts, which serve as silent witnesses to their heated exchange.\n",
      "CHARACTERS\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "ELIZABETH MONTAGUE: In her late thirties, Elizabeth has piercing blue eyes and shoulder-length dark hair, often styled in an elegant yet assertive manner. She dresses conservatively but stylishly, reflecting her status. Her expression is often intense, filled with anger and frustration.  ETHAN: A younger man in his mid-twenties with tousled hair and a casual, laid-back demeanor. He dresses in casual attire but has an undeniable charm. His youthful defiance is juxtaposed with Elizabeth’s seriousness, and he often wears a sly grin even in tense moments.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "The museum is filled with lavish decor, from gilded frames to marble sculptures, presenting a stark contrast to the emotional turmoil of the characters. Large windows allow natural light to flood the space, illuminating the intricate details of the historical artifacts. The sound of footsteps echoes against the polished wooden floors, enhancing the gravity of their argument amidst the opulence of their surroundings.\n",
      "AUDIO\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "ELIZABETH: Her voice is sharp and commanding, filled with emotion and urgency. She emphasizes key words to convey her intensity. ETHAN: His tone is playful yet defiant, often punctuating his words with a mocking laughter that highlights his rebellious nature. Their voices create a dynamic contrast, filling the museum with tension.\n",
